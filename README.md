# Amazon-Reviews-NLP
This is a semester long research project for the Natural Language Processing course at the University of Houston.
1 Introduction
The project implements a boolean search system for aspect-based opinion analysis of Amazon
product reviews. The goal is to retrieve relevant reviews that match specific aspect pairs and
opinions. The implementation includes three baseline boolean methods and three advanced
methods that improve search relevance through rating validation, sentence-level analysis,
and LSA-based semantic matching.

2 Getting Started
2.1 Installing Python Libraries
To ensure all necessary libraries are installed, use the providedrequirements.txtfile. Run
the following command in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt This will
install all required dependencies for the project.

2.2 Running the Code
The project allows you to run various search methods using the following input commands.
Replace-aspect1,-aspect2,-opinion, and-methodwith the desired values.

python booleansearchhelp.py --aspect1 aspect1 --aspect2 aspect2 --opinion
opinion --method method

3 Implementation Details
3.1 Data Structures
The system uses two primary data structures:

Word to Integer Mapping: Maps preprocessed words to sets of document indices
Integer to Review Mapping: Maps integer indices to review IDs
3.2 Text Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes several steps:

Case normalization
Stop word removal
Punctuation removal
Word lemmatization using NLTK
Alphanumeric filtering
3.3 Search Methods
3.3.1 Baseline Methods

Method 1: OR Operation
Implements: aspect1 OR aspect2 OR opinion
Returns documents containing any search term
Provides maximum recall
Method 2: AND Operation
Implements: aspect1 AND aspect2 AND opinion
Returns documents containing all search terms
Provides maximum precision
Method 3: Mixed Operation
Implements: (aspect1 OR aspect2) AND opinion
Combines aspect flexibility with opinion requirement
Balances precision and recall
3.3.2 Advanced Methods

Method 4: Window-based Scoring
Uses sliding window approach
Considers word proximity in scoring
Incorporates rating validation
Employs adaptive scoring based on distance
Method 5: N-gram based filtering method
Employs sentence-level tokenization to extract n-grams
Identifies and evaluates aspect-opinion pairings using n-grams
Cross-validates results with rating consistency
Applies n-gram frequency and relevance for sentence-based scoring
Method 6: LSA-based Semantic Search
Uses Latent Semantic Analysis
Captures semantic relationships between terms
Implements cosine similarity scoring
Includes visualization of results

4.2 Evaluation Metrics
The scores in the results represent a combined evaluation metric that consists of three main
components:

4.2.1 Term Presence Score (0-1)

Measures how well the search terms appear in the retrieved documents.
Higher values indicate better matches between search terms and document content.
Example:Method 2 consistently scores higher (0.47-0.49) because it finds documents
containing all search terms.
4.2.2 Rating Consistency (0-1)

Evaluates how consistent the ratings are across retrieved documents.
Based on the standard deviation of ratingsâ€”more consistent ratings score higher.
Normalized so that lower standard deviation gives scores closer to 1.

4.2.3 Cohesion Score (0-1)

Measures how similar the retrieved documents are to each other using TF-IDF vectors.
Uses silhouette score converted to a 0-1 range.
Higher values indicate more cohesive/similar document sets.
The final score is the average of these three components, explaining why:
Method 2 (AND operation) scores highest (0.47-0.49) as it finds very specific
matches with all terms.
Methods 3 and 4show moderate scores (0.36-0.42), balancing specificity and cover-
age.
Methods 1, 5, and 6show lower scores (0.23-0.27) due to retrieving more diverse
results.
Looking at each method:
Method 2: High scores reflect precise matches but very few documents.
Method 4: Good scores with fewer documents show effective filtering.
Method 1: Lower scores but high retrieval show broad coverage.
Method 6 (LSA):Consistent moderate scores indicating semantic matching.
Method 5: Varied scores reflect the impact of n-gram expansion.
Method 3: Balanced scores show effective compromise between precision and recall.
5 Conclusions
The implementation demonstrates the utility of combining traditional boolean search meth-
ods with advanced features such as sentence-level analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA). While baseline methods provided foundational capabilities, the advanced methods
significantly improved precision and relevance.

5.1 Key Findings
Baseline Methods: OR, AND, and Mixed operations offered diverse trade-offs be-
tween recall and precision.
Advanced Methods: Sentence-level analysis and LSA captured nuanced semantic
and contextual relationships, enabling more relevant document retrieval.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision and consistency scores validated the enhanced per-
formance of advanced methods.
The findings underscore the importance of advanced opinion mining and semantic analysis
techniques for improving search relevance in real-world applications.
